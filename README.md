# Project Summary
Elist Electronics, established in 2018, is a global e-commerce company that sells popular electronic products worldwide via its website and mobile app.

The company has significant amounts of data on its sales, marketing efforts, operational efficiency, and loyalty program that has been previously underutilized.
Hence, I analyze those data to investigate the trend and sales growth by starting with the analysis of the key metrics such as 
Sales, order, revenue, Average order value( AOV), Year of growth year (YoY), Market Channel, Product Popularity, Refund Rate, Efficiency Shipping. Also how to 
improve the loyalty program  to assess its effectiveness in overall sales, AOV, and total orders.


This project thoroughly analyzes and synthesizes this data in order to uncover critical insights that will improve Elist's commercial success.
Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

In this project, I analyzed a dataset to investigate trends and growth rates in revenue, average order value (AOV), product popularity, marketing channels, refund rates, and shipping efficiency. Additionally, I closely examined their recently launched loyalty program to assess its effectiveness in overall sales, AOV, and total orders.

This project consists of four parts:
- <b>Part 1: Trends</b>
  * Using Excel, I take a high-level look at some of the broad trends within the data to see what notable insights can be pulled out for the finance and product team.
- <b>Part 2: Targeted Insights</b>

  * With the aid of SQL, I pull out more targeted insights for the finance and marketing team, highlighting things like MacBook sales, refund rates, and best performing marketing channels.

- <b>Part 3: Visualizations</b>
  * Leveraging Tableau, I create a dashboard for the finance and product teams (as well as the sales and operations teams to a lesser extent) to monitor metrics of interest on an ongoing basis.

- <b>Part 4: Recommendations & Next Steps</b>
  * Suggestions on things to take a look at going forward.

The data I'll be using is spread out across four tables and consists of information on orders, order statuses, customers, and geographic information.

Here is the Entity Relationship Diagram:
